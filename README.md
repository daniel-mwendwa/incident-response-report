## Introduction
Incident Response (IR) is a structured approach to detecting, managing, and mitigating cybersecurity threats. This report provides insights into handling incidents effectively to minimize downtime and impact.

## Incident Response Frameworks
We compare **NIST** and **SANS** frameworks:
- **NIST:** Four-phase approach - Preparation, Detection & Analysis, Containment & Eradication, and Post-Incident Activity.
- **SANS:** Six-phase model - Preparation, Identification, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, and Lessons Learned.

## Preparation
Key activities include:
- Developing an Incident Response Plan (IRP)
- Implementing access controls and backups
- Deploying **SIEM** and **EDR** tools
- Conducting risk assessments and training teams

## Detection & Analysis
Detection involves identifying suspicious activity using logs, SIEM alerts, and **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**. This report includes a **Windows Workstation investigation**, showcasing:
- Identifying malicious processes
- Checking outbound connections
- Analyzing infected files

## Containment, Eradication, and Recovery
- **Containment:** Isolating the affected system to prevent malware spread.
- **Eradication:** Removing malicious files and registry entries.  
- **Recovery:** Restoring the system and verifying no persistence mechanisms exist.

## Post-Incident Activity
Key lessons include:
- Updating security policies and procedures
- Enhancing detection mechanisms
- Conducting training for future readiness

## Conclusion
Incident response is a continuous improvement process. Strengthening cybersecurity defenses requires learning from incidents and adapting to evolving threats.
